# Intro to MRSI Portal Content Management

We have migrated the website from Umbraco to Gatsby.

The content of your pages consist of:

- Markdown files and Images (Stored in the [Content Folder]() on GitHub)
  - These markdown files and images can be edited by you on Github.
- Files in File Library (Stored in the Cloud)
  - The files in your file library cannot be directly edited by you, you must email us what changes you want to be done to your File Library

## What is Markdown?

Markdown allows you to add styling to a document in plain text.

Here are some examples:

- `**bold**` -> **bold**
- `*italics*` -> _italics_
- `~~strike~~` -> ~~strike~~

You can find a Markdown formatting cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Here is an example of the markdown file for a COS Page:

![Annotated Markdown file](./images/MarkdownFileAnnotated.PNG)

There are two sections to a markdown file:

- The **frontmatter** section which has key, value data. This is where the following data lives:
  - POC Name and Email information
  - Related Links
  - Cerousel Image Paths
- The **markdown content** section which is where the text of your page will live, you can also insert images here.

## What is Github?

Github is a website that allows us to store code and other files associated with our website.

Everytime a change is made to the files on Github, they are pushed to the website.
