## What is Markdown?

Markdown allows you to add styling to a document in plain text.

Here are some examples:

- `**bold**` -> **bold**
- `*italics*` -> _italics_
- `~~strike~~` -> ~~strike~~

You can find a Markdown formatting cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Here is an example of the markdown file for a COS Page:

There are two sections to a markdown file:

- The **frontmatter** section which has key, value data. This is where the following kind of data lives:
  - POC Name and Email information
  - Related Links
  - Cerousel Image Paths
- The **markdown content** section which is where the text of your page will live, you can also insert images here.
