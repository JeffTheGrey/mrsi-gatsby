  - [ ] all inline images have been placed into the markdown
  - [ ] all markdown headings are the correct depth (h1, h2, h3)
  - [ ] update the page_last_reviewed date? should we have all the cos people review the page before we launch?
- [ ] Modify file/folder naming/structure to our liking

Notes

- NWO content folder has image folders so that might have messed up the script to add images to the markdown files, i should move images outside of image folders and update markdown accordingly
- TAM content folder has many images in their center_home_page folder, i need to check this out and see why they are there and if i need to remove any of those
- There were errors with the python script creating the markdown files for sam/fwh and tam/detention
