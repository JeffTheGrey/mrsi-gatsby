Location: Fort Bragg, NC
Technology: Ground Source Heat Pumps, High Performance Building Envelopes, Lighting and Daylighting, Low Impact Development, Solar Hot Water
POC: Savannah District

Highlights:
34.1% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
82.8% reduction in water use
90.4% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

A key objective of this project was to demonstrate that off-the-shelf building materials and
integrated design can result in a high-performance facility. Engaging key installation stakeholders
in a charrette process using BIM and energy modeling was crucial to success. The project achieved
LEED platinum certification for efficient water, energy, lighting and material uses in addition to
numerous other sustainable strategies.
