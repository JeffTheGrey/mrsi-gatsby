The TEMF combines a motor-pool for large equipment with supporting administrative and training functions. Several sustainable technologies are showcased in this building. The most innovative is a “Solar Air Heating” system. Often known as “SolarWall”, it’s both a passive cooling and active heating system. It works by capturing the sun’s radiant energy into a column of air trapped in a cavity created within a special metal wall panel. During hot periods of the day it creates a chimney effect and passively channels hot air away from the building. This uses no energy and allows the building to remain cooler than a conventional building. When the building needs to be heated, the captured warm air is mechanically pulled into the HVAC system.
