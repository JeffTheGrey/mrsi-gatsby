# Facility Information

## Description

The Transient Training Officers Quarters houses unaccompanied officer personnel in Active and Reserve Component units training at sites other than home station (in other words, annual training for Reserve Components). This CATCD may also be used for OCONUS annual training quarters. The Transient Training Officers Quarters Army Standard Design provides parameters for basic, austere but durable facilities.
The Transient Training Officers Quarters applies to Active, Reserve and National Guard Component facilities on Army Installations, with the exception of facilities intended for permanent party (non-transient), Initial Entry Training, Advanced Individual Training, or Warrior Transition Units, which are addressed by separate Standard Designs.

## Variations

There are no variations on this facility standard design.
