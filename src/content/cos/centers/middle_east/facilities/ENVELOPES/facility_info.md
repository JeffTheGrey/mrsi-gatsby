# Space Information

There are 7 Envelopes to choose from when selecting a facility

1. Common Uniform Building Envelope (CUBE)

-The CUBE dimensions are 7.3M x 4.9M, which is the size of a single modular "Bay". The structure, including the foundation are is build entirely out of wood, and can be constructed in 40 hours. This is a temporary facility to be occupied no more than 5 years.

2. Standard Adaptive Facility Envelope (SAFE)

- The SAFE is a modular structure that is 2 bays wide (14.6M), and typically 7 bays long (34.3M). The Envelope is designed for two story construction and can be shortened or stretched by the standard bay length. It is also a protected structure with integral protective roof. This is a great choice for billeting, Administrative space, & Operations

3. Standard Adaptive Facility Envelope (SAFE1)

- The SAFE1 is a modular structure that is 2 bays wide (14.6M), and typically 7 bays long (34.3M). The Envelope is designed for single story construction and can be shortened or stretched by the standard bay length. It is also a protected structure with integral protective roof. This is another great choice for billeting, Administrative space, Operations, Dining, & MWR

4. Tactical Earthen Rapidly Raised Assembly Hut (TERRA HUT)

- The TERRA HUT is a modular structure that is 2 sideways bays wide (9.8M), and typically 2 bays long (14.7M). The Envelope is designed for single story construction and can be shortened or stretched by the standard bay length. The envelope is constructed with onsite soils 10%-20% clay, 65%-80% sand, 10%-20% silt and 7% cement. The equipment needed is a EARTH BLOX BP714 from Dwell Earth and mixer. Blocks to cure for 7 days prior to use. This is an excellent choice for locations with limited materials.

5. Four Area CMU Envelope (FACE)

-The FACE is a modular structure that is 2 bays wide (14.6M), and typically 7 bays long (34.3M) and is constructed out of CMU. The Envelope is designed for single story construction and can be shortened or stretched by the standard bay length.

6. Standard Adaptive Wood Structure (SAWS)

- The SAWS is a modular structure that is 2 bays wide (14.6M), and typically 7 bays long (34.3M). The Envelope is constructed out of wood. It is designed for single or two story construction and can be shortened or stretched by the standard bay length. This is a great choice for billeting, Administrative space, & Operations

7. Multi Use Tall Envelope (MUTE)

- The MUTE is a modular structure with slightly different Bay Sizes (6.2M x 6M). The facility is 2 Bays (12.4M) Wide and typically 15 Bays (90.5M) long. The Envelope is constructed out of Metal, and is designed to be shortened or stretched by Bay lengths. This is a great choice for Storage, Maintenance or the Fire Station.
