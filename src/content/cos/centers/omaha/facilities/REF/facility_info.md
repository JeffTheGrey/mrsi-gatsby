# Facility Information

## Description

This Army Standard for Religious Education Facilities (Category Code 73018) serves all Soldiers, their Family Members, retirees, DOD civilians, and other authorized personnel on a military garrison. This standard functions as part of a Chapel “functional unit”, which consists of a worship supporting component and a religious education supporting component that together supports the full slate of Chaplaincy programs. When the religious education supporting component is combined in a project with the worship supporting component, the set will be referred to as a Chapel Complex. Since the worship supporting component may be provided as a "stand-alone" project (and has a separate Category Code), it is addressed in a separate Army Standard for General Congregation Chapels.
