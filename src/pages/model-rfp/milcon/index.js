      The RFP Wizard for MILCON D-B&nbsp;is an application for creating a
      Request For Proposal (RFP)&nbsp;using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
      approved Model RFP templates for new U.S. Army Military Construction
      (MILCON) Design-Build (D-B) projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application was developed to simplify the RFP creation process and to
      ensure a standardized RFP is generated that is suitable for solicitation
      and is consistent with Army and USACE policy, regulation, Army Standards,
      and Standard Designs.

      <strong>History of RFP Wizard:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The years following the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005
      authorization saw a major surge in MILCON to accommodate base
      restructuring and accelerate transition to the Army Modular Force. Between
      Fiscal Years (FY) 2008 and 2013, more than $18 billion in construction had
      to be completed, requiring the Army to demand innovative, more efficient
      methods for facility delivery. During this time, the Army
      Staff&nbsp;(ARSTAF) and numerous members of USACE&nbsp;organizations
      collaborated to solve the intricate problems related to redesigning the
      MILCON process.&nbsp;One of the&nbsp;solutions that emerged was&nbsp;the
      standardization and automation of the RFP&nbsp;process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The&nbsp;new process&nbsp;would ensure consistency and criteria compliance
      during design authoring and reviews, contract awards, and delivery of
      facilities. To support the new&nbsp;acquisition strategies, the Model
      Request for Proposal (Model RFP) template was created. The Model RFP is
      generated using a web-based tool called the RFP Wizard. The RFP Wizard is
      an interactive tool allowing individuals with MRSI accounts to enter data
      related to a specific project (utilities, layout, etc.) in order to
      determine the appropriate configurations and parameters for the unit. To
      insure inputted data remains within the required Standards, the RFP Wizard
      is programmed to prevent deviation from the standard design criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first version of the RFP Wizard launched in the fall of 2006, prior to
      the development of MRSI. The RFP Wizard was mandated by HQUSACE for use on
      all MILCON Transformation Design-Build projects in FY08. A new version of
      the RFP Wizard tool was developed in 2009. Over 500 RFP projects, with
      nearly 50 million square feet in scope, have been produced using the RFP
      Wizard tool.
