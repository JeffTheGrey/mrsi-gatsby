      The&nbsp;<em>RFP Wizard for Small Projects</em> provides a standardized
      way to support the creation of Request For Proposal (RFP) documents for
      the design and construction of facility Sustainment, Restoration, and
      Modernization (SRM) and small Military Programs work. The
      <em>&nbsp;RFP Wizard for Small Project</em> capitalizes on the previous
      development and success of the&nbsp;<em>RFP Wizard for MILCON </em>for new
      construction, and&nbsp;facilitates a comprehensive approach to small
      project RFP development.

        Memorandum for the Under Secretary of Defense (10 Sep 2013)
      </a>{" "}
      requires "a standardized process for facility condition assessments to
      ensure consistent and reliable data necessary for sound strategic
      investment decisions in managing the Department's built
      environment."&nbsp; This policy further mandates that&nbsp;Defense
      Components (e.g. Army, Air Force and Navy) adopt a common process (NLT
      FY19) that incorporates the Sustainment Management System (SMS) developed
      by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineer Research and Development
      Center - Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL). This
      includes the BUILDER module in the SMS suite of applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER standardizes work items utilizing{" "}
      <a href="http://www.uniformat.com/index.php/classification-of-building-elements">
        UNIFORMAT II
      </a>{" "}
      - a consistent description of facility systems and components.&nbsp; The{" "}
      <em>RFP Wizard for Small Projects</em> allows designers to utilize
      UNIFORMAT II building element classifications to create consistent RFPs
      across all of USACE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the use of UNIFORMAT II work items in the RFP Scope of Work
      (Section 01 10 00) supports future "round-tripping" of work items back to
      BUILDER.&nbsp; While this functionality is currently only available in a
      subset of projects, it is expected to be rolled-out to all&nbsp;projects
      later this year with the release of a consolidated <em>RFP Wizard.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      In&nbsp;either method,&nbsp;the <em>RFP Wizard for Small Projects </em>
      uses the UNIFORMAT II compliant standard for&nbsp;organizing
      the&nbsp;scopes of work to ensure future mapping to BUILDER, which will
      expedite the execution of Small Projects for all stakeholders.
